# Carve3D
Code for CVPR 2024 paper, *Carve3D: Improving Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency for Diffusion Models with RL Finetuning*.  
[Project Website](https://desaixie.github.io/carve-3d/)  [ArXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13980)

Code coming soon...

## Release TODOs
- [ ] training and testing text prompt dataset
- [ ] SDXL LoRA training code adapted from [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/text_to_image/train_text_to_image_lora_sdxl.py) and [DDPO](https://github.com/kvablack/ddpo-pytorch)
- [ ] Multi-view Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric pseudo code
  - MRC can be fully implemented with an open-sourced multi-view/sparse-view reconstruction model, such as [OpenLRM](https://github.com/3DTopia/OpenLRM), [GRM](https://github.com/justimyhxu/grm), [LGM](https://github.com/3DTopia/LGM), etc. Pull requests are welcome!
